# Liberty portal template- test pr changes again

This repo includes several packages:
1. `studio` - sanity studio
2. `beauty-portal-theme` - Gatsby theme for the portal
3. `web` - Gatsby website, based on `beauty-portal-theme`

## Configuration

1. `web` supports configuration files (`packages/web/.env.production`, `packages/web/.env.development`) where you can specify required env vars.

Currently, we have included all the environment variables for you inside provisioning, in case you want addition functionality like addition of sanity read token just include environment variables as follows: 

````
app_local_sanityToken = "yourTokenValue"

````

2. Algolia Integration is provided by default with a search index created by Platform Liberty Team, if you want to provision search with algolia. in case you want to override these setting change the Algolia Keys located inside .env files. Also, to create new indexes specific to your needs , please uncomment the `gatsby-algolia-plugin` located inside `beauty-portal-theme/gatsby-config.js`. This will enable the gastby to interact with algolia at the time build process. 

Also, to make these overridden settings effective at CI/CD , you need to add following github repo secrets:

````
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=<<value>>
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=<<value>>

````
